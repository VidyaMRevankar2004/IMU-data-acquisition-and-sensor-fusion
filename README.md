# IMU-data-acquisition-and-sensor-fusion
This project involves acquiring motion data from an IMU and position data from a GPS module. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to fuse these sensor readings to improve accuracy. The fused output provides stable estimates of position, velocity, and direction for use in navigation systems.
